# RS-SDK

Research-oriented starter kit for runescape-style bots, including a typescript sdk, agent documentation and bindings, and a server emulator. Works out of the box - tell it what to automate!

Build and operate bots within a complex economic role-playing MMO. You can automate the game, level an account to all 99s, and experiment with agentic development techniques within a safe, bot-only setting.

The goals of this project are to provide a rich testing environment for goal-directed program synthesis techniques (Ralph loops, etc), and to facilitate research into collaboration and competition between agents.

![Task Length Distribution](content/title/task_length.svg)

There is currently a [leaderboard](https://rs-sdk-demo.fly.dev/hiscores) for bots running on the demo server, with rankings based on highest total level per lowest account playtime.


## Getting Started:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MaxBittker/rs-sdk.git
```

Out of the box, you can connect to the provided demo server, but be sure to chose a name that is not already taken!

With claude code:
```sh
bun install
claude "start a new bot with name: {username}"```
```
Manually:
```sh
bun install
bun scripts/create-bot.ts {username}
bun bots/{username}/script.ts 
```

Warning: The demo server is offered as a convenience, and we do not guarantee uptime or data persistence. Hold your accounts lightly, and consider hosting your own server instance. Please do not manually play on the demo server. 


> [!NOTE]
> RS-SDK is a fork of the LostCity engine/client. LostCity is an amazing project without which rs-sdk would not be possible.

## Gameplay Modifications

This server has a few modifications from the original game to make development and bot testing easier:

- **Faster leveling** - The XP curve is made accelerated and less steep.
- **Infinite run energy** - Players never run out of energy 
- **No random events** - Anti-botting random events are disabled 


## Running the server locally:
You want all these running: 
```sh 
cd engine && bun run start
```
```sh 
cd webclient && bun run watch
```
```sh 
cd gateway && bun run gateway
```
there is also a login server which you may not need
