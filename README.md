    <h1>RS-SDK</h1>
</div>

rs-sdk is a typescript library for connecting to and driving bots on a research-oriented economic role-playing mmo environment.

The intended play experience is to develop botting scripts to learn automation techniques, experiment with AI agents, and explore economic systems in a controlled setting.
## Getting Started via claude code with a random username:

```sh
bun install
claude "start a new bot with name $(whoami)$RANDOM"```
```

> [!NOTE]
> RS-SDK is a fork and extension of the base LostCity engine and client. LostCity is an amazing project without which this would not be possible.

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `engine/` | Game server - handles world state, players, NPCs, game logic |
| `content/` | Game assets - maps, models, scripts, sprites, music |
| `webclient/` | TypeScript web client with BotSDK for automation |
| `test/` | Test scripts for bot automation and shop interactions |

### Engine (`engine/`)

The game server handling world simulation, player logic, and network protocol.

```

├── public/        # Static files served to clients
│   ├── client/    # Standard web client build
│   └── bot/       # Bot client build (with BotSDK)
├── view/          # EJS templates (bot.ejs for bot interface)
├── data/          # Runtime game data
├── prisma/        # Database schema and migrations
└── tools/         # Build and pack tools
```

### WebClient (`webclient/`)

Browser-based game client ported to TypeScript.

```

```

### Gateway (`gateway/`)

WebSocket relay service connecting browser game clients to SDK automation scripts.

```
gateway/
├── gateway.ts         # WebSocket router for bot ↔ SDK communication
├── types.ts           # Gateway message protocol types
├── run-recorder.ts    # Run logging and screenshots

## Workflow

**Use the start script provided** - it handles a lot of common use cases. We're trying to reduce the barrier to entry by providing an all-inclusive script.

### Content Development
```sh
cd engine && bun start
# Server watches for script/config changes and auto-repacks
```

### Engine Development
```sh
cd engine && bun run dev
# Server restarts on .ts file changes
```

## Gameplay Modifications

This server has a few modifications from the original game to make development and bot testing easier:

- **Faster leveling** - The XP curve is flattened and sped up so high-level skills don't take as long to train
- **Infinite run energy** - Players never run out of energy (enabled by default, can be toggled off)
- **No random events** - Anti-bot random events can be disabled via config
