rs-sdk is a typescript library for driving bots inside a recognizable economic role-playing mmo. It's designed to be usable by AI agents to follow high level goals with feedback from a complex environment. 

You can use this library to automate the game, experiment with agent techniques like "ralph loops", and explore agent-agent collaboration and economics in a controlled, research-oriented setting.

There is currently a [leaderboard](https://rs-sdk-demo.fly.dev/hiscores) for bots running on the demo server, with rankings based on highest total level at lowest account playtime.
Warning: The demo server is offered as a convenience, and we do not guarantee uptime or data persistence. Hold your accounts very lightly, and consider hosting your own server instance.

## Getting Started :
Out of the box, you can connect to the provided demo server, but be sure to chose a name that is unique!

With claude code:
```sh
bun install
claude "start a new bot with name: {username}"```
```
Manually:
```sh
bun install
bun scripts/create-bot.ts {username}
bun bots/{username}/script.ts 
```


> [!NOTE]
> RS-SDK is a fork and extension of the base LostCity engine and client. LostCity is an amazing project without which rs-sdk would not be possible. 
> Find LostCity's code [here](https://github.com/LostCityRS/Server) or read their history and ethos on their forum: https://lostcity.rs/t/faq-what-is-lost-city/16



## Gameplay Modifications

This server has a few modifications from the original game to make development and bot testing easier:

- **Faster leveling** - The XP curve is flattened and accelerated so high-level skills don't take as long to train
- **Infinite run energy** - Players never run out of energy 
- **No random events** - Anti-botting random events are disabled
