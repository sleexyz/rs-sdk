This repo contain:
A game server (hosted by default at https://rs-sdk-demo.fly.dev/)
A browser-based game client (hosted by default at https://rs-sdk-demo.fly.dev/)
A gateway service for connecting bot clients to SDK agents
A BotSDK library for writing automation scripts in TypeScript

By default you can build bots by only writing scripts that use the botsdk library, without modifying the server or client code, 
but if you want to develop deeper changes to the stack or host your own server, all the source code is included in this repo to do so.


## Directory Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sdk/` | BotSDK library for writing automation scripts |
| `sdk/test/` | Test scripts for bot automation and shop interactions |
| `server/engine/` | Game server - handles world state, players, NPCs, game logic |
| `server/content/` | Game assets - maps, models, scripts, sprites, music |
| `server/webclient/` | TypeScript web client with BotSDK for automation |
| `server/gateway/` | WebSocket relay for bot clients to connect to SDK agents |

### Engine (`server/engine/`)

The game server handling world simulation, player logic, and network protocol.

```
engine/
├── src/           # Server source code
├── public/        # Static files served to clients
│   ├── client/    # Standard web client build
│   └── bot/       # Bot client build (with BotSDK)
├── view/          # EJS templates (bot.ejs for bot interface)
├── data/          # Runtime game data
├── prisma/        # Database schema and migrations
└── tools/         # Build and pack tools
```

### WebClient (`server/webclient/`)

Browser-based game client ported to TypeScript.

```
webclient/
├── src/
│   ├── client/    # Standard client code
│   └── bot/       # Bot-specific modules (BotSDK)
├── out/           # Built client bundles
│   ├── standard/  # Standard client output
│   └── bot/       # Bot client output
└── 3rdparty/      # Third-party dependencies
```

### Gateway (`server/gateway/`)

WebSocket relay service connecting browser game clients to SDK automation scripts.

```
gateway/
├── gateway.ts         # WebSocket router for bot ↔ SDK communication
├── types.ts           # Gateway message protocol types
├── run-recorder.ts    # Run logging and screenshots
└── agent-state/       # Live state files per bot
```

## Workflow

**Use the start script provided** - it handles a lot of common use cases. We're trying to reduce the barrier to entry by providing an all-inclusive script.

### Content Development
```sh
cd server/engine && bun start
# Server watches for script/config changes and auto-repacks
```

### Engine Development
```sh
cd server/engine && bun run dev
# Server restarts on .ts file changes
```
